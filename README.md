# Incredible-Optimization
# 简体中文

这是一个基于Forge平台的Minecraft整合包，它是在“难以置信的优化”的启发下开发的。起初，我只是想自己制作一个模组包来娱乐，但意外地发现优化效果非常好。随后，我注意到了这个整合包，由于它没有Forge版本，我便顺手制作了一个。

这个整合包的功能与“难以置信的优化”相似，主要都是围绕优化展开的。不过，我们在此基础上增加了一些辅助功能和信息显示。我们没有包含地毯和彗星端这两个模组，因为它们会让游戏显得过于作弊，这样做的目的是为了提升游戏体验，同时也帮助新手玩家更好地进行游戏。整合包中包含的一些模组可能对新手玩家来说较为复杂，不易理解。

问题：

问：还会继续制作更多版本吗？

答：目前仅制作了1.20.1版本，至于其他版本，将取决于作者是否有足够的时间。

备注：需要强调的是，这个整合包与“难以置信的优化”并无关联，它仅仅是作者在无聊时自行开发的一个项目。

This is a Minecraft modpack based on the Forge platform, inspired by the "Incredible Optimization." Initially, I just wanted to create a modpack for personal entertainment, but I unexpectedly found that the optimization effects were very good. Later, I noticed that this modpack did not have a Forge version, so I decided to make one myself.

The features of this modpack are similar to "Incredible Optimization," mainly focusing on optimization. However, we have added some auxiliary functions and information displays on top of that. We did not include the Carpet and Comet mods because they can make the game feel too cheaty. The goal is to enhance the gaming experience while also helping new players better enjoy the game. Some mods included in the modpack might be a bit complex and difficult for new players to understand.

Regarding:

**Q: Will you continue to make more versions?**
**A:** Currently, only the 1.20.1 version has been made. Whether there will be other versions will depend on whether the author has enough time.

**Note:** It is important to emphasize that this modpack is not related to "Incredible Optimization." It is simply a project developed by the author in their free time.
